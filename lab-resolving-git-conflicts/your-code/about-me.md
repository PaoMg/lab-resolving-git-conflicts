# Who am I

Hi Everyone! I'm pao malherbe from Mexico city. I'm an innovation and strategy consultant and in one week I'll move to another job to become an architect strategy engineer
I love data (specially excel because it's the only platform I know so far haha) and I love to tell stories with it


# Why am I here

I came to Ironhack to get the necessary skills to understand and manipulate data so that I can give good insights to my clients and so they can make important decissions
I hope to learn story telling with data and good tools to show them


# What will I do after the bootcamp?

After the bootcamp I hope to be part of a tech industry and have the necessary abilities to help clients in their decissions
I really would love to be part of TED talks related to tech and data, and how it helps in the improvement of people
